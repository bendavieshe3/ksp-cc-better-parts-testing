    title = Test Basic SRB Operation

    description = Whats better than strapping yourself to a liquid-fuelled rocket and holding the throttle open? Strapping yourself to solid-rocket and not having a choice but to keep the throttle open! We think there is a future for this cheap and powerful rocket technology here, even if it is a future dominated by fireballs. How do we prove our theory? This is where you come in.

    notes = Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are rocket engines using a cured solid fuel for propellant. SRBs are useful for generating sufficient thrust during the boost phase of a space rocket launch. They are relatively cheap, but not very flexible. Designed for atomspheric use, they generally don't perform well in vaccuum and famously cannot be shutdown prior to exhaustion except via destructive intervention. 

    synopsis = Launch a vessel to orbit using the RT-10 SRB
    completedMessage = Congratulations! You've learnt basic Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) usage!
