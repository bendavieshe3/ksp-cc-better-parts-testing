    description = It is no surprise that what goes up frequently comes down. When it does it tends to explode. We believe fitting vessels with a parachute is one excellent way to prevent this. We need someone to test this theory. This, of course, is where you come in.

    notes = Parachutes are a relatively inexpensive way to decelerate vessels attempting landings on bodies with atmospheres, including Kerbin. Parachutes can be deployed directly or via the staging system. It is generally not a good idea to deploy parachutes too early. 

    synopsis = Launch a vessel to the minimum height and land it safely on Kerbin using a parachute
    completedMessage = Congratulations! You've learnt basic parachute usage!
