# Better Parts Testing

## Introduction

*Better Parts Testing* is a contract pack for [Kerbal Space Program][2]. It is designed to work with (and requires) the the [Contract Configurator][3] mod.

The goal of this contract pack is to provide *sensible* parts testing contracts for the purpose of:
* assisting new players in understanding the 'correct' or expected way to use vessel parts
* encouraging players to use parts they might not otherwise use regularly

## Status 

Licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][1]

This contract pack is *barely started*. The contracts within are at different
stages of readiness and should be used with caution. 

If you would like to help out or suggest changes please use the [Contract Configurator development thread][4] or create issues on the [Github repository][5].
